    <p><h2>The Best Pie</h2></p>

    <p>Known as the “pie plant,” brilliant pink and green rhubarb makes a tart and fruity pie that’s worthy of its nickname.</p>

    <p>You know it's spring when rhubarb shoots appear in your yard. Finally, you have summer to look forward to and a whole season of fresh pies. Because of this early start and rhubarb's ubiquity in pies, it has even garnered the nickname "pie plant." </p>

    <p>Rhubarb is incredibly sour when raw. It seriously makes you pucker. My parents grow rhubarb in their yard, and every spring when I was little, my dad and I would take a bite from a fresh stalk and compete to see who could recover enough to whistle first after such a tart bite. But don't worry; behind its sour bite is a distinctive citrusy and fruity flavor when cooked and tamed with sugar. </p>
